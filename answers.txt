1. The data is already organized, which reduces the complexity of the solution.
2. There is a creation method for each file. Inserting new fields is possible by expanding the corresponding creation method with new fields (keys) in the creation dictionary.
3. The solution would be expanded. Before using the data, it would be collected. The part already implemented would not need to be changed.
4. About 1 hour
